it is about selecting 2 movies, displaying and comparing those 2 movies side by side.

In the background an [Online-Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/) is used to get the needed information. Afterwards this data is compared. The 'better' entry is marked in green, the worse movie-property is marked in yellow. The application was styled using [Bulma Css](https://bulma.io/).
